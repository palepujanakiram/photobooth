// Web stub for api_client.g.dart
// This file provides web-compatible stubs for the generated code
// The actual api_client.g.dart will never be executed on web since
// ApiService bypasses Retrofit and uses Dio directly on web.

// Stub File class for web that has a path property
// This is only used for type checking, never executed
class File {
  final String path;
  File(this.path);
}

// Stub Platform class for web
class Platform {
